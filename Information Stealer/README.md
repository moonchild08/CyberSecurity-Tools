# ü¶π Information Stealer

This project demonstrates how saved credentials, clipboard content, and basic system information can be programmatically accessed on a local machine.  


---
## Features
- Extract saved browser credentials (from Chrome local database).
- Decrypt stored passwords using Windows API & AES keys.
- Capture clipboard content.
- Collect system and network information:
  - OS version & architecture
  - Hostname & IP address
  - MAC address
  - Processor details
  - Public IP lookup

---

## How It Works
- **Password extraction:** Reads Chrome‚Äôs `Login Data` SQLite database, retrieves encrypted credentials, and decrypts them using the system‚Äôs key.
- **Clipboard capture:** Retrieves currently stored clipboard content.
- **System info:** Gathers OS, hardware, and network details for forensic awareness.
