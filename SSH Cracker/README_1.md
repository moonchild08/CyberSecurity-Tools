# üîê SSH Brute-Force Tool
A Python-based SSH brute-force script that attempts to log in to a target host using a username and a list of passwords.
Built with Paramiko, it automates the process of testing multiple credentials against an SSH server.

## Features
1. Tries multiple passwords from a given wordlist against an SSH server
2. Handles:\
   2.1 Connection timeouts\
   2.2 Authentication failures\
   2.3 Temporary lockouts (retries after delay)
3. Saves valid credentials to credentials.txt
4. Color-coded terminal output (success in green, errors in red/blue)

## Tech Stack
1. Python 3
2. Paramiko\
 (SSH handling)
3. Colorama\
 (colored output)

### Install dependencies:
pip install paramiko colorama

## Usage

Run the script:\
python ssh_bruteforce.py <host> -u <username> -P <password_list>

Example:\
python ssh_bruteforce.py 192.168.1.10 -u root -P rockyou.txt

### Example Output

-> Testing from Windows 11 (Host) to Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)

### üëâ If successful, the credentials will be saved to:

credentials.txt

example content:\
root@192.168.1.10:toor

## Future Improvements
1. Add multi-threading for faster brute force
2. Support for username lists
3. Integrate with proxy chains / TOR for anonymity
4. Add logging & reporting features
