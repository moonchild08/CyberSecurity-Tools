# üîë FTP Brute Force Script 

A simple multithreaded FTP brute-force script written in Python using the `ftplib` library.  
This project is designed **only for ethical use** in penetration testing labs, Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges, or cybersecurity learning environments.  



---

## Features
- Multithreaded password attempts (default: 30 threads).
- Customizable host, port, and username.
- Reads passwords from a wordlist file.
- Displays credentials if login is successful.
- Gracefully stops after finding valid credentials.

---

## How It Works
1. Loads a wordlist from `wordlist.txt`.
2. Each password is queued for brute-forcing.
3. Threads run in parallel, attempting to connect via FTP.
4. On success:
   - Prints valid credentials.
   - Stops further attempts.

## Usage

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install colorama
```


2Ô∏è‚É£ Add your wordlist:\
wordlist.txt


3Ô∏è‚É£ Edit the script:\
commands to be run on target machine(here, kali linux)

```bash
sudo apt install vsftpd -y

sudo systemctl start vsftpd

sudo systemctl startus vsftpd
```





4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the script:\
On the main machine
``` bash 
python ftp_brute.py
```
